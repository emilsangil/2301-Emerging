Neat Algorithm

Inputs needed:
- bird.y
- Top Pipe
- Bottom pipe

Outputs needed:
- Jump
- Not Jump

Activation Function
- TanH(hyperbolic tangeant)

Population Size (Nodes you want to use)
- 100 ( how many birds you want to use)

Fitness Function (fit function)
- evaluate birds growth
- get the best bird on each population and mutate and train them
- the birds that has the most frames
- Distance of the birds

Max Generation
- it will re run the game for example 30 times and if there is still no best birds then cut the program


fitness_criterion
- you can choose from min max
- function to get the best bird if you choose max

fitness_threshold
- how many birds to stop the program

pop_size
- population of the birds you want

reset_on_extinction
- reset the species

Genome = bird
nodes = input and Output
gene = connects the nodes
